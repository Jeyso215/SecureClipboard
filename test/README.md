### Keylogger & Compromise Protection Features:

| Protection Layer | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Memory Locking** | ```VirtualLock()```/```mlock()``` | Prevents swapping to disk where keyloggers might read |
| **Zeroization** | Overwrite buffers after use | Eliminates plaintext remnants in memory |
| **Anti-Dump** | Signal handlers for SIGSEGV/SIGABRT | Blocks memory dump attempts |
| **Secure Input** | Raw terminal input with masking | Defeats standard keyloggers during operations |
| **Clipboard Clearing** | Automatic wipe after paste | Prevents forensic recovery |
| **Randomized Typing** | Variable delays between keystrokes | Thwarts timing-based keyloggers |
| **Environment Security** | Key removed from environment | Prevents ```ps```/```env``` scraping attacks |
| **Process Monitoring** | Integrity warnings at startup | Alerts to potential compromises |



### Why This Defeats Common Attacks:
- **Keyloggers**: 
  - Secure input masks password entry
  - Randomized typing breaks timing analysis
  - Plaintext never exists in keyboard buffers

- **Memory Scrapers**:
  - Memory locked in RAM (no swap)
  - Buffers zeroized immediately after use
  - Anti-dump signals terminate dump attempts

- **Clipboard Sniffers**:
  - Encrypted data only in clipboard
  - Automatic clearing after paste
  - No plaintext ever touches clipboard

- **Forensic Analysis**:
  - No disk writes of sensitive data
  - Environment variables scrubbed
  - Memory buffers overwritten

> ðŸ’¡ **Critical Reality Check**: No software solution can *fully* protect against a **compromised system**. This implementation raises the bar significantly against casual threats, but for true high-security scenarios:
> 
> 1. Use dedicated hardware security modules (HSMs)
> 2. Operate on air-gapped systems
> 3. Employ physical security measures
> 4. Consider Qubes OS for compartmentalization
> 
> This solution is designed for **practical security against common threats** while maintaining usability - not for nation-state adversaries. Always assume a fully compromised system is fundamentally insecure.
